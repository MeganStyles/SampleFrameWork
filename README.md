# SampleFrameWork
Very small test framework for API and DB connections and me trying to figure out how visual studio web api projects work.
I found that i couldn't directly access the objects of the project because it is a .netCore and the test skeleton was .netFramework.
I decided to work around it and create mocks becasue this is a small project, and the point was to practice creating a framework from scratch, not to mess around with .netCore web api projects.. although that was fun too.
